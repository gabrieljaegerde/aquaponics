#Aquaponics 101

Here is a how the aquaponics system currently works (I plan to add an image later onto this repository):
- Lower water tank: It is where the fish habitat is located (fish species to be determined). This allows the plants to gain a source of nitrogen to build nucleic acids/other macromolecules via collecting fish bodily waste. To fully automate this aspect of the ecosystem, a mechanism in which food can be automatically sent to the fish is required. This needs to check that the fish get sufficient food while not overfeeding them.
- Upper water tank: This is where the plants are being grown (plant species TBD). Algae will likely bloom in this tank due to the seeds found on the rocks we collected. This needs to be monitored too since algae might compete with the other plants (the ones we desire) for sunlight and other natural resources. The process may be automated but it might be comparatively harder to implement.
- Filtration system: This is used to remove excess dirt coming from the plants so that the fish can thrive in the most optimal manner. Needs to check water purity and pH level.

Things to possibly automate:
- pH level monitoring- if it gets too extreme, do something about it.
- Water purity monitoring- if it gets too dirty, remove the water immediately.


Fish Recommendation for Aquaponic Small Tank (1m x 1.5m):

******************************************************************
TILAPIA:
Pros:
Fast growth rate.
Hardy and tolerant of fluctuating water conditions.
Efficient feed converters.
Versatile for aquaponic systems.

Cons:
Requires warm water temperatures (around 80°F) for optimal growth.
May become aggressive towards other fish, especially during breeding season.
Not suitable for cold water aquaponic systems.
******************************************************************
GOLDFISH:

Pros:
Colorful and attractive.
Hardy and easy to care for.
Can tolerate a wide range of water conditions.
Produce ample waste for plant nutrients.

Cons:
Can produce excessive waste, leading to water quality issues if not managed properly.
Growth rate may be slower compared to other species.
Limited for commercial harvesting due to smaller size and less flesh.

******************************************************************

CATFISH:
Pros:
Hardy and resistant to diseases.
Can tolerate low oxygen levels.
Good for warm water environments.
High-quality flesh for consumption.

Cons:
Needs adequate space and may outgrow smaller tanks quickly.
Can be messy eaters, leading to waste accumulation.
Requires regular maintenance to prevent overpopulation and water quality problems.

******************************************************************

KOI:
Pros:
Beautiful and decorative.
Hardy and adaptable to various water conditions.
Can tolerate cooler temperatures.
Produce ample waste for plant nutrients.

Cons:
Can grow quite large and may outgrow smaller tanks.
High initial cost due to their decorative value.
Require good filtration to maintain water clarity and quality.

******************************************************************

TROUTS:
Pros:
Fast-growing and suitable for colder water environments.
High market value for consumption.
Can be harvested within a shorter timeframe compared to other species.
Provide excellent water quality indicators.

Cons:
Demand higher oxygen levels, which may require additional aeration in the tank.
Can be sensitive to water quality fluctuations.
Not suitable for warmer water environments.

******************************************************************

PERCH:
Pros:
Hardy and adaptable to different water conditions.
Good for small-scale aquaponic systems.
Fast-growing and suitable for warm water environments.
Delicate flavor makes them desirable for culinary purposes.

Cons:
Require specific diets for optimal growth.
May exhibit cannibalistic behavior if overcrowded.
Prone to stress-related diseases if water conditions are not carefully monitored.
