# Aquaponics

What did you eat for breakfast today? Where did that food come from? Like me, you probably have no idea...

I am cycling around the world at the moment and seeing how our food is grown is honestly disgusting in many cases. At this point, you might be thinking, that developed countries have their stuff figured out but NO!!! In Italy I saw tomatoes growing in the midst of trash! While I was cycling through Greece in autumn 2020, farmers were burning plastic on the farmland accross the country! I don't mean to pick on any country here. How many times did I notice batteries on fields next to roads in Germany... But I wonder how much other stuff ends up in the farmlands next to streets anyways. The plants breathing car exhaust all day doesn't sound all to appetizing either.

My point being...
The best way to make sure you are getting healthy, fresh and nutritious food is by growing it yourself. And that is why intend to do. Aquaponics is a growth method that is suitable to urban areas, organic and it allows for complete input control (and thus automation). My goal for this repo is to start experimenting with aquaponic systems and to automate them. I want to do this in an open source way and together with like-minded individuals design and build a cheap, efficient system that can easily be scaled up.
