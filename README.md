#Aquaponics 101

Here is a how the aquaponics system currently works (I plan to add an image later onto this repository):
- Lower water tank: It is where the fish habitat is located (fish species to be determined). This allows the plants to gain a source of nitrogen to build nucleic acids/other macromolecules via collecting fish bodily waste. To fully automate this aspect of the ecosystem, a mechanism in which food can be automatically sent to the fish is required. This needs to check that the fish get sufficient food while not overfeeding them.
- Upper water tank: This is where the plants are being grown (plant species TBD). Algae will likely bloom in this tank due to the seeds found on the rocks we collected. This needs to be monitored too since algae might compete with the other plants (the ones we desire) for sunlight and other natural resources. The process may be automated but it might be comparatively harder to implement.
- Filtration system: This is used to remove excess dirt coming from the plants so that the fish can thrive in the most optimal manner. Needs to check water purity and pH level.

Things to possibly automate:
- pH level monitoring- if it gets too extreme, do something about it.
- Water purity monitoring- if it gets too dirty, remove the water immediately.
