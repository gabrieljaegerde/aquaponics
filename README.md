#Aquaponics 101

Here is a how the aquaponics system currently works (I plan to add an image later onto this repository):
- Lower water tank: It is where the fish habitat is located (fish species to be determined). This allows the plants to gain a source of nitrogen to build nucleic acids/other macromolecules via collecting fish bodily waste. To fully automate this aspect of the ecosystem, a mechanism in which food can be automatically sent to the fish is required. This needs to check that the fish get sufficient food while not overfeeding them.
- Upper water tank: This is where the plants are being grown (plant species TBD). Algae will likely bloom in this tank due to the seeds found on the rocks we collected. This needs to be monitored too since algae might compete with the other plants (the ones we desire) for sunlight and other natural resources. The process may be automated but it might be comparatively harder to implement.
- Filtration system: This is used to remove excess dirt coming from the plants so that the fish can thrive in the most optimal manner. Needs to check water purity and pH level.

Things to possibly automate:
- pH level monitoring- if it gets too extreme, do something about it.
- Water purity monitoring- if it gets too dirty, remove the water immediately.

filter options:

Mechanical filtration:
 This stage involves removing solid waste particles from the water. This can be done using filters such as foam filters, filter socks, or settling tanks where particles settle out of the water.

 1. Foam filters: 
 Porous foam blocks or pads that trap solid waste particles as water passes through.

 2. Filter socks: 
 Mesh socks or bags that catch debris and waste as water flows through them.

 3. Settling tanks: 
 Large tanks where water flows slowly, allowing solid waste to settle at the bottom for removal.

Pros:
Effectively removes solid waste particles, keeping the water clear and preventing clogs in the system.
Relatively simple and low-cost to implement.

Cons:
Requires regular maintenance, such as cleaning or replacing filter media, to prevent clogging and maintain efficiency.
May not remove dissolved organic compounds or harmful chemicals from the water.
===================================================================
Biological filtration: 
Beneficial bacteria colonize surfaces within the filter and convert harmful ammonia, produced by fish waste, into nitrites and then into nitrates, which are less harmful to fish and serve as a nutrient source for plants.

1. Biofilter media: Porous materials such as bio balls, ceramic rings, or plastic bio balls provide surface area for beneficial bacteria to colonize and break down ammonia and nitrites.

2. Moving bed biofilters: 
Systems where biofilter media are constantly agitated or moved, promoting bacterial growth and water circulation.

3. Fluidized bed filters: 
High-flow systems where biofilter media are suspended in water, creating an environment for efficient bacterial colonization.

Pros:
Converts toxic ammonia and nitrites into less harmful nitrates, helping to maintain water quality and support fish health.
Creates a stable and self-regulating ecosystem with minimal intervention.

Cons:
Takes time to establish beneficial bacterial colonies, requiring a period of cycling before the system becomes fully functional.
Sensitive to fluctuations in water parameters such as pH and temperature, which can disrupt bacterial activity.
=========================================================
Plant-based filtration: 
Aquaponic systems often include plants, typically grown hydroponically, which further filter the water by absorbing nutrients and removing impurities.

1. Hydroponic grow beds: Containers filled with a growing medium (like gravel or clay pellets) where plants are grown without soil. The roots of the plants absorb nutrients from the water, helping to filter it.

2. Raft systems:
 Floating platforms where plants are grown directly on the water surface, with their roots submerged. As the plants grow, they absorb nutrients and filter the water.

Pros:
Utilizes natural processes to remove nutrients and pollutants from the water, improving water quality and supporting plant growth.
Enhances system productivity by providing a secondary crop (edible or ornamental plants).

Cons:
Requires careful selection of plant species to ensure compatibility with aquaponic conditions and optimal nutrient uptake.
May require additional lighting or nutrient supplementation for optimal plant growth, depending on the system setup.
==============================================================
 Additional filtration: 
Depending on the specific needs of the system, additional filtration components such as activated carbon filters or UV sterilizers may be incorporated to further purify the water or control algae growth.

Pros:
Provides supplemental purification and sterilization of the water, reducing the risk of disease outbreaks and algae blooms.
Helps to control odors and improve water clarity.

Cons:
Can be expensive to purchase and operate, adding to the initial cost and ongoing maintenance of the aquaponic system.
Overuse of chemical filtration methods like activated carbon may inadvertently remove beneficial nutrients from the water, affecting plant health.
